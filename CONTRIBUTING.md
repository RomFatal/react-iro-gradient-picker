## About This Project

React Iro Gradient Picker is an enhanced version of react-gcolor-picker with complete dark theme support, modern Tailwind CSS styling, and improved TypeScript integration. We welcome contributions that align with these goals.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains several key folders:

- `/src` contains all the React components with enhanced dark theme support
- `/stories` contains our Storybook documentation with dark theme examples
- `/.storybook` contains Storybook configuration with dark theme setup
- `/demo.html` is our standalone demo showcasing dark theme features

## What We're Looking For

We're particularly interested in contributions that enhance:

- **Dark Theme Support** - Improvements to the dark theme integration
- **Accessibility** - Better keyboard navigation, screen reader support, ARIA labels
- **TypeScript** - Better type definitions and type safety
- **Performance** - Optimizations and performance improvements
- **Documentation** - Better examples, guides, and API documentation
- **Testing** - Unit tests and integration tests for new features

## Setup and Run

To setup and run a local copy:

1. Clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/romfatal/react-iro-gradient-picker`
2. Run `npm install` in the root folder
3. Run `npm run storybook` to start the development environment with dark theme examples
4. Open `demo.html` in your browser to see the standalone demo

You should now be up and running with live browser reloading of the Storybook examples while you work on React components in the `/src` folder.

## Testing and Development

We use modern development tools for the best experience:

```sh
npm run build      # Build the library
npm run storybook  # Start Storybook with dark theme examples
npm test          # Run tests (when available)
```

The project uses:

- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling and theming
- **Storybook** for component documentation and examples
- **Rollup** for building the library
